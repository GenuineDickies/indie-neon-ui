# 🚀 GitHub Pages Setup Guide

Your repository is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment with automated workflows!

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Created** (`.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`)
   - Automatically deploys on every push to `main` branch
   - Can also be triggered manually

2. **Documentation Files Created**
   - `docs.html` - Redirects to main documentation
   - All documentation files updated with correct URLs

3. **URLs Updated**
   - Live Demo: `https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/demo.html`
   - Component Docs: `https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/`

4. **.gitignore Updated**
   - Now ignores development tools (.amazonq/, .cursorrules, etc.)

## 📋 Next Steps: Enable GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Open your browser and go to: https://github.com/GenuineDickies/indie-neon-ui
2. Click on **Settings** (tab at the top)
3. Scroll down and click on **Pages** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Configure Source
Under **Build and deployment**:
- **Source**: Select **GitHub Actions** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
  
This tells GitHub to use the automated workflow we just created.

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to the **Actions** tab: https://github.com/GenuineDickies/indie-neon-ui/actions
2. You should see a workflow running called "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
3. Wait for it to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. When it shows a green checkmark ✅, your site is live!

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
Once deployed, your demo will be available at:

- **Live Demo**: https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/demo.html
- **Component Documentation**: https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/
- **Index/Redirect**: https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/

## 🎯 Quick Setup (Step-by-Step with Screenshots)

### Visual Guide:

1. **Settings → Pages**
   ```
   Repository → Settings → Pages (left sidebar)
   ```

2. **Configure Source**
   ```
   Build and deployment:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Source: [GitHub Actions ▼]      │
   └─────────────────────────────────┘
   ```

3. **Save (Automatic)**
   - No save button needed - it auto-saves when you select GitHub Actions

4. **Check Actions Tab**
   ```
   Repository → Actions → "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
   ```

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Deployment
Every time you push to `main` branch:
1. GitHub Actions workflow triggers automatically
2. Uploads all files as a GitHub Pages artifact
3. Deploys to `https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/`
4. Your demo is updated within 1-2 minutes

### Manual Deployment
You can also trigger deployment manually:
1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select `main` branch
5. Click "Run workflow"

   ```

2. **Interactive Demo** (with color slider)
   ```
   https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/demo.html
   ```

3. **Component Documentation**
   ```
   https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/index.html
   ```

4. **Direct CDN Access**
   ```
   https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/dist/indie-neon-ui.min.css
   https://genuinedickies.github.io/indie-neon-ui/dist/indie-neon-ui.min.js
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Not Running?
- Check Actions tab for errors
- Verify you selected "GitHub Actions" as source (not branch)
- Make sure workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`

### 404 Error?
- Wait 2-3 minutes after first deployment
- Check that Pages is enabled in Settings
- Verify workflow completed successfully (green checkmark)

### Wrong Content Showing?
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check workflow run logs for errors
- Verify version numbers updated (should be v1.0.0)

### CSS/JS Not Loading?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `dist/` folder is committed to repository
- Check that file paths are relative (not absolute)

## 🎨 Customizing Your Demo

### Update the Demo
1. Edit `demo.html` or `index.html` locally
2. Commit changes: `git commit -am "Update demo"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
4. Workflow automatically deploys (1-2 minutes)

### Add New Components
1. Add component to `css/` and `js/`
2. Run `node build.js` to rebuild
3. Update `index.html` with documentation
4. Commit and push - automatically deploys!
